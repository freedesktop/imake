The imake package contains the imake utility, plus the following support
programs:

   - ccmakedep
   - mergelib
   - revpath
   - mkdirhier
   - makeg
   - cleanlinks
   - mkhtmlindex
   - xmkmf

Most usage will also require installing the Xorg util/cf files which contain
the platform-specific configuration data for known platforms.

The X Window System used imake extensively up through the X11R6.9 release,
for both full builds within the source tree and external software.
X moved to GNU autoconf and automake for its build system in 2005 for
X11R7.0 and later releases, but still provides imake for building existing
external software programs that have not yet converted, though we are not
actively maintaining it for new OS or platform releases.
